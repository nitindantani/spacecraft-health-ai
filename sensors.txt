🛰️ 1️⃣ Why sensors are labeled X, Y, Z

Spacecraft lives in 3-D space.

So every physical quantity is measured along 3 axes:

X → left–right direction
Y → forward–back direction
Z → up–down direction

This coordinate system is fixed to the spacecraft body.

Engineers call this the body reference frame.

Why we need all three axes

Because motion, vibration, and heat are never perfectly symmetric.

Example:

landing shock may be stronger downward → Z axis spike

rover movement may be forward → Y vibration

instrument heating may be one side only → X temp rise

If we measure only one direction, we miss real behaviour.

So X/Y/Z = full spatial understanding.

🌡️ 2️⃣ Thermal sensors (Temp X, Y, Z)

These measure temperature at different parts of the payload.

They are not random duplicates.

Each axis sensor is placed in a different orientation on the instrument.

What they tell engineers
✔ Power stress

If electronics overheat, temperature rises.

✔ Sun exposure

If one side faces Sun → that axis heats.

✔ Cooling system failure

Thermal gradient appears between axes.

✔ Lunar environment effects

Night/day cycles cause slow temp drift.

Why three temperature sensors

Because:

Uniform heating  → normal
One-axis heating → possible fault
Rapid temp change → possible electronics issue

So temp X/Y/Z helps detect spatial heat imbalance.


🧭 3️⃣ Accelerometer sensors (Coarse)

These measure large mechanical motion.

Placed to capture spacecraft body movement.

What they tell engineers
✔ Landing shock

Huge Z-axis spike.

✔ Structural vibration

Repeated oscillations.

✔ Thruster firing effects

Directional acceleration.

✔ Rover movement

Periodic vibration pattern.

Why coarse sensors exist

They capture big motion, but may miss subtle signals.

Think of them as:

Low sensitivity
Wide measurement range


🔬 4️⃣ Accelerometer sensors (Fine)

These measure tiny vibrations.

Much more sensitive than coarse ones.

What they tell engineers
✔ Seismic activity on moon surface
✔ Instrument micro-movement
✔ structural resonance
✔ sensor drift

These can detect motion invisible to coarse sensors.

Why both coarse AND fine exist

Because spacecraft needs:

Coarse → detect big shocks
Fine   → detect tiny signals

If only fine sensors exist:

they saturate during big shock

If only coarse exist:

they miss small anomalies

So both together give full picture.

🧠 5️⃣ How engineers interpret sensor behaviour

They don’t look at single values.

They look at patterns across axes.

Examples:

Example A — Thermal imbalance
Temp X ↑↑
Temp Y normal
Temp Z normal

Possible meaning:

one side heating

insulation problem

component overheating locally

Example B — Landing shock
Accel Z huge spike
Accel X small
Accel Y small

Meaning:

vertical impact

normal landing behaviour

Example C — Mechanical drift
Fine Y oscillation
Coarse Y stable
Temp stable

Meaning:

instrument vibration

not structural shock

possible internal resonance

🚀 6️⃣ Why this matters for OUR AI project

our AI models don’t just see numbers.

They see physical behaviour patterns.

So when our model says:

Temp Y abnormal + Accel Y abnormal

It might mean:

Heat causing structural stress in that direction

That’s real spacecraft interpretation.

“Each sensor measures physical behaviour of the spacecraft in a specific spatial direction.
X, Y, Z axes allow us to detect directional heat imbalance, vibration patterns, landing shocks, and structural drift.
Using multiple axes gives spatial understanding of spacecraft health, which our AI models learn automatically.”
